## Contribution note
This project is a personal tool and the code is quite messy. Unlike many of my other projects I have not and most likely will not use Conventional Commits, Semver or any other specific structure for this project. If you want to contribute, please don't. :) If there is a feature you would like to see, just make an issue and I will consider it.
